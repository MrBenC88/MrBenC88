## Hello, I am Ben! (he/him)ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŽ“ I am a CS student at the [**University of British Columbia**](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver, BC. My previous degree was a B.Sc in Honours Biochemistry at the [**University of Windsor**](https://www.uwindsor.ca/). 

âœ¨ I am an advocate for fostering positive team relationships and championing the vision that tech can be for everyone. As a big believer in giving back to the community, I have a passion for sharing my knowledge through [workshops](https://github.com/MrBenC88/Backend-Workshop), [blogs](https://mrbenc.medium.com/), and [guides](https://mrbenc.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-ubcs-bachelor-of-computer-science-second-degree-program-b357156a9be5) to inspire students to [**boldly build**](https://medium.com/@mrbenc/to-boldly-build-insights-for-new-developers-to-kickstart-their-projects-d7354a15b396). 

âš¡ Outside of work, I am managing my communities, reading light novels, working on collaborative passion projects, rushing to complete a hackathon submission, or feeding in a game of ARAM.
