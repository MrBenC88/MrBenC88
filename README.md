I am a student at the [**University of British Columbia**](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver, BC ‚ú®. My previous degree was a B.Sc in Honours Biochemistry at the [**University of Windsor**](https://www.uwindsor.ca/). Currently, I am pursing a second degree in Honors Computer Science in the Faculty of Science. <br/>

I am an advocate for fostering positive team relationships and championing the vision that tech can be for everyone. I am a big believer in giving back to the community and have a passion for sharing my knowledge through [blogs and guides](https://medium.com/@mrbenc) to inspire students to [boldly build](https://medium.com/@mrbenc/to-boldly-build-insights-for-new-developers-to-kickstart-their-projects-d7354a15b396). I am excited to bring this passion for improving individuals and communities into my work.<br/>

This upcoming Fall, I will be interning with [**Checkfront**](https://www.checkfront.com/) as a software developer. <br/>

In the past, I have built numerous Java and Python based games, as well as tools that enhance student experiences. A particularly interesting project developed with React is:<br/>

[**UBC Course Explorer**](https://ubcexplorer.io/) - A modern course search tool that enables all students to browse UBC course prerequisites and dependencies.<br/>
[**BCS Degree Navigator and Dashboard**](https://ubcexplorer.io/bcs) - A modern dashboard with increased functionality related to course search features such as a worklist builder, degree progress tracker, and overview for users to quickly see their progress stats.<br/>

Outside of work and academia, I am a sponsorship coordinator at [**nwPlus UBC**](https://www.nwplus.io/)‚Äî the team behind Western Canada‚Äôs largest hackathon, nwHacks, North America‚Äôs largest Local Hack Day 2018, and Vancouver BC‚Äôs first all-female* 24-hour hackathon, cmd-f.<br/>

I'm currently looking for internships for Winter (Jan-Apr) ‚ùÑ  and Summer (May-Aug) ‚òÄ 2021.
