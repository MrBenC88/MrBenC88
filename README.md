## Hello, I am Ben! (he/him)ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŽ“ I am a CS student at the [**University of British Columbia**](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver, BC. My previous degree was a B.Sc in Honours Biochemistry at the [**University of Windsor**](https://www.uwindsor.ca/). 

âœ¨ I am an advocate for fostering positive team relationships and championing the vision that tech can be for everyone. As a big believer in giving back to the community, I have a passion for sharing my knowledge through workshops, blogs, and guides to inspire students to [**boldly build**](https://medium.com/@mrbenc/to-boldly-build-insights-for-new-developers-to-kickstart-their-projects-d7354a15b396). 

âš¡ Outside of work, you can find me managing my communities, reading light novels, working on collaborative passion projects, rushing to complete a hackathon submission, or feeding in a nice game of ARAM.

### Let's connect! 
â˜• Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat over (virtual) coffee! I am thrilled to meet new people and learn about their journey.<br/>
